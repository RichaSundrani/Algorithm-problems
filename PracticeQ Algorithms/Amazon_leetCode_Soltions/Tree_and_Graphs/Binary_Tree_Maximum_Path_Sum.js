/*
Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum
A path in a binary tree is a sequence of nodes where each pair of adjacent nodes in the sequence has an edge connecting them. A node can only appear in the sequence at most once.
Note that the path does not need to pass through the root.
The path sum of a path is the sum of the node's values in the path.
Given the root of a binary tree, return the maximum path sum of any path.
Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The optimal path is 2 -> 1 -> 3 with a path sum of 2 + 1 + 3 = 6.
Example 2:
Input: root = [-10,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 42
Explanation: The optimal path is 15 -> 20 -> 7 with a path sum of 15 + 20 + 7 = 42.
Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 3 * 10^4].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000

var maxPathSum = function (root) {

        if (tree == null) { return 0 } // Termination condition

        const leftBranch = Math.max(0, getMaxSum(tree.left)) // calculate the root to leaf sum where root is the left node
        const rightBranch = Math.max(0, getMaxSum(tree.right)) // calculate the root to leaf sum where root is the right node
        const currentPath = leftBranch + tree.val + rightBranch  // Sum the path: left -> root -> right (leaf to leaf)

        max = Math.max(max, currentPath) // if the current path is greater than the previous value of `max`, update `max` to the current path sum
